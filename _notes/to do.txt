project 2 to do
____________________
in progress

____________________
next up

upon signing up, make st in user table = -1
	use throughout site to mean 'no ST yet'

if search returns 0 songs, stay on same page (w/ search entries intact), but don't go to confirmation

update nav section
	prevent pages if not logged in (redirect)
		most done; check if all work
	merge login/signup pages (and buttons)
		make always on navbar, unless signed in (then logout button)

process.js
	summary.ejs loads before new additions to db
		async.waterfall instead?

____________________
questions

change /results GET routes to POST?

____________________
results.js

allow song add with incomplete fields
	if no title entered
		search by artist only
	if no artist entered
		search by title only

'simon & garfunkel' didn't return any songs
	maybe because of special character '&'?
	improve filtering

results.js
	make links array iterative
		use similar process as for AJAX call
		req.query.artist_0 (etc) from for loop...
	try async.waterfall (instead of async.concat)
____________________
results.ejs
	mack back button to add page
		store data in session
