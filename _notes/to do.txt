____________________
in progress

____________________
next up

questions

change /results GET routes to POST?

____________________
results.js

allow song add with incomplete fields
	if no title entered
		search by artist only
	if no artist entered
		search by title only

'simon & garfunkel' didn't return any songs
	maybe because of special character '&'?
	improve filtering

results.js
	make links array iterative
		use similar process as for AJAX call
		req.query.artist_0 (etc) from for loop...
	try async.waterfall (instead of async.concat)
____________________
results.ejs
	mack back button to add page
		store data in session
