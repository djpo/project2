questions

db
	associations?
		models.user.hasMany(models.favorite);
		models.favorite.belongsTo(models.user);

change /results GET routes to POST?

____________________
results.js

do not make 1st API request if both fields blank
	don't add link to links array

allow song add with incomplete fields
	if no title entered
		search by artist only
	if no artist entered
		search by title only

'simon & garfunkel' didn't return any songs
	maybe because of special character '&'?
	improve filtering

results.js
	make links array iterative
		use similar process as for AJAX call
		req.query.artist_0 (etc) from for loop...
	try async.waterfall (instead of async.concat)
____________________
results.ejs
	mack back button to add page
		store data in session
