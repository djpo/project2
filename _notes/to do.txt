	use similar process as for AJAX call

____________________
questions

res.render vs. res.redirect...

db
	validations?
	associations?
		models.user.hasMany(models.favorite);
		models.favorite.belongsTo(models.user);

change /results GET routes to POST?

async.waterfall vs. async.concat?

____________________
results.js
do not make 1st API request if both fields blank
	don't add link to links array

allow song add with incomplete fields
	if no title entered
		search by artist only
	if no artist entered
		search by title only

'simon & garfunkel' didn't return any songs
	maybe because of special character '&'?
	improve filtering
