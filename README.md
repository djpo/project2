## Soul Tempo

deployed here: http://soultempo.herokuapp.com/

This is my second project for General Assembly's Web Development Intensive course (Seattle cohort #05). It is my first full-stack web app with a functional server.

I primarily used Node and Express for this app. It uses the Echo Nest API to access song audio information.

The site is operational, but I will be making many improvements in the near future.
